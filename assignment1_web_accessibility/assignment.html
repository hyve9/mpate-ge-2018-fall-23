    <!-- Issue #1: No alt text for the image.
                   This image does not have alt text, so users with screen readers are left guessing
                   what the image might display. Furthermore, the image file itself is non-descriptive
                   so even tech-savvy screen reader users are left in the metaphorical dark.
                   To resolve, it's as easy as adding an alt text key in the img tag.

    <!-- Issue #2 (multiple): Navigation that doesn't actually go anywhere
                  While the site attempts to be helpful by including navigation at the top of the page,
                  the navigation doesn't actually go anywhere. This is unclear to users with screen readers.
                  Furthermore, 3 of the 4 content sections do not exist. If the section is a work in progress,
                  the section itself can still exist, perhaps with a "WIP" header next to it.
                  To resolve, each section should be separated with a named div tag, and the navigation
                  section should actually bring you to the named div.
                  Note: I'm removing the first two links since they don't actually link to anything.

    <h1>Vinyl Records</h1>
      <body>
        <p>Vinyl records, often simply called &quot;vinyl&quot;, represent a significant era in the history of music recording and playback. Emerging in the early 20th century, these flat discs primarily made of polyvinyl chloride became the mainstay for music enthusiasts, artists, and DJs around the world. With their unique grooves, which are literally the physical imprint of sound waves, vinyl provided listeners an analog warmth and depth of sound that many argue hasn&#39;t been replicated by digital formats. The tactile experience of placing a needle onto a spinning disc, combined with the large, artistic album covers, made listening to vinyl an immersive experience.</p>

    	  <p>In recent years, vinyl has experienced a surprising resurgence. While the digital age has made music more accessible than ever, a growing number of music enthusiasts are returning to vinyl for its nostalgic appeal and the distinct audio quality it offers. For these aficionados, the act of collecting and playing records provides a tangible connection to the music, allowing them to engage with their favorite tunes in a manner that digital streaming can&#39;t capture. The renewed interest in vinyl speaks to its enduring charm and the timeless allure of analog sound in a rapidly evolving digital world.</p>
        <p>The vintage charm of vinyl records is irreplaceable...</p>

    <!-- Issue #5: Audio
                  There is no description of the audio for deaf or hard of hearing users.
                  While there is a filename that says "vinyl-sound.mp3", this is not sufficient
                  description. To resolve, there should be a heading or label that clearly describes
                  what content is going to play. For good measure, we can ensure that the audio
                  starts muted and autoplay is disabled explicitly.

    <!-- Issue #3: Non-functioning search function
                  It is not clear what purpose this search section serves. Is it a google search?
                  Site search? This is just text with no functionality. This should either be
                  implemented or removed.
                  Since this is not a large website and a search bar feels unnecessary, I will
                  remove this entirely.

    <!-- Issue #4: Unclear newsletter subscription functionality
                  This section has a "Join Our Newsletter" header and text that says "subscribe",
                  but neither of these have any function or onclick event. There should likely
                  be a button titled "Subscribe" under the text "Join our Newsletter" with some
                  event tied to it. I have added a button (but disabled it, as I did not implement
                  any newsletter subscribing functionality.)
