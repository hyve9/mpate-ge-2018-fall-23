# Assignment #1: Web Accessibility

Objective: This assignment aims to evaluate your familiarity with common accessibility issues encountered in websites according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In this assignment, you will identify common accessibility problems and provide recommendations for improving the accessibility of a live website.

_Submission:_ Please submit for this assignment as a single compressed file:

    A text document with the requested details
    The modified HTML code

## Part 1: Rectifying Accessibility Errors

A local webpage ("assignment.html") has been provided to you. This webpage contains accessibility-related errors that violate the principles of WCAG. Your task is to identify and fix at least five (5) accessibility errors. For each error:

    - Fix the error in the code.
    - Provide a clear description of where the error is located.
    - Clearly articulate the nature of the error and its implications for users.
    - Describe the solution you implemented to address the error, including any code changes, if applicable.
    - Provide a rationale for your solution, explaining why it improves accessibility.

## Part 2: Evaluating a Live Website

Select a popular or well-known website of your choice. It can be an e-commerce platform, a news site, a social media platform, etc. Examine the selected website for potential accessibility issues and suggest at least four (4) improvements. Access to the underlying HTML is not necessary; you may use tools like Reader view or a screen reader to identify potential issues. In the submission:

    - Provide the URL of the website you selected.
    - For each potential accessibility issue identified:
      - Describe the issue in detail.
      - Explain the implications of the issue for users.
      - Provide a suggestion for improving the issue.

# Evaluation Criteria:

    *Depth of understanding:* Your explanations should display a deep understanding of the nature of the accessibility errors and their impact on users.
    *Solution appropriateness:* Your fixes and suggestions should be practical, effective, and aligned with WCAG guidelines.
    *Clarity:* Your explanations and rationales should be clear, concise, and well-organized.

_Note:_ You may use accessibility evaluation tools (e.g., axe, WAVE) to assist in identifying issues, but ensure you understand why these issues are flagged by the tool. Itâ€™s not just about code changes but understanding the user experience.
