1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,691
There's an old joke, um.

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:04,247
Two elderly women are at a
Catskill mountain resort,

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:07,671
and one of 'em says, "Boy, the food
at this place is really terrible." 

4
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:10,888
The other one says, "Yeah, I
know; and such small portions."

5
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:13,441
Well, that's essentially
how I feel about life

6
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:17,273
full of loneliness, and misery,
and suffering, and unhappiness,

7
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:19,873
and it's all over
much too quickly.

8
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,074
The other important
joke for me,

9
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,999
is one that's usually
attributed to Groucho Marx 

10
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,086
but I think it originally
appears in Freud's

11
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,114
"Wit and it's Relation
to the Unconcious"

12
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,410
and it goes like this
(I'm paraphrasing): 

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,012
"I would never want to
belong to any club

14
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:36,420
that would have someone
like me for a member."

15
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,967
It's the key joke of my adult life in
terms of my relationships with women. 

16
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:44,273
You know, lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind, cause

17
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:48,381
I turned 40, and I guess I've been going
through a life crisis or something

18
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:50,874
And I'm not worried about aging, you
know, I'm not one of those characters

19
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,165
Although, I'm balding slightly on top,
that's the worst you can say about me

20
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:56,989
I, um, I think I'm going to
get better as I get older

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,894
You know, I think I'm going to be
the, the "balding virile" type

22
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:03,507
As opposed to, say, the, um,
"distinguished grey", for instance

23
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,535
Unless I'm neither
of those two

24
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,829
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,901
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag screaming about socialism.

26
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:17,417
Annie and I broke up, and I still can't
get my mind around that, you know

27
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:21,847
I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship
through my mind and examining my life

28
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:25,406
and trying to figure out "Where
did the screw-up come?" you know?

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,301
A year ago we were in love,
you know? And, and - 

30
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:34,539
It's funny - I'm not a morose type. I'm
not a depressive character.  I, uh,

31
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:39,879
I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess, I was
brought up in Brooklyn during World War II.
