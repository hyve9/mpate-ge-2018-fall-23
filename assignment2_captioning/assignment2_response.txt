1. Describe your approach to creating captions for the video. Did you focus on specific aspects, like timing, conciseness, or the inclusion of non-speech sounds?

I essentially made sure that the main parts of the speech were there, and focused less on repeated words, ums, and breaths. I wanted the subtitle changes to not be too early to avoid "giving away" any of the content.

2. What challenges did you encounter during the captioning process? Consider issues related to timing, content representation, or the subtitling software.

Getting the subtitles not to overlap with each other, and shifting the titles forwards or backwards (ensuring that subsequent and antecedent titles also shift by the same amount.

3. How did you overcome the challenges you faced? Share the strategies or methods you employed to address issues and improve your captions.

In general, there wasn't much "overcoming", I just had to spend extra time hand-editing the timestamps and subtitle location to ensure accuracy and avoid overlaps. I'm sure that there are
ways to do this automatically that are built into the software, but as I am not that familiar with the software I simply did a lot of it by hand. 
One thing that helped was typing everything out before hand, and then adjusting the timestamps later. Although this was annoying to shift individual titles, I didn't have to stop
and replay the clip multiple times to get the gist of what was being said.
